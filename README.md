## Project Ideas

### Yosef

Idea 1(vague) School Bus App:

An app for school bus drivers and parents for bus drivers to have an easier and more efficient way for organizing on what kids to drop off and where, as well as a way for parents to know when their kid is arriving.

* login system for both bus driver to log into school and parent to login
* notification system for parents that let them know from the bus driver that they arrived at the childs address
* an easy to read list for bus driver of the kids that are on the bus
* once the bus driver selects a kid on the list, a map shows up so they can drop him/her off (with directions maybe?)
* (going off from the list of kids from 2 points ago) a checklist type of thing where the buss driver checks off which kid got dropped off


@YosefSamman please if any, add WireFrame.
