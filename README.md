## Project Ideas

### Yosef

Idea 1(vague) School Bus App:

An app for school bus drivers and parents for bus drivers to have an easier and more efficient way for organizing on what kids to drop off and where, as well as a way for parents to know when their kid is arriving.

* login system for both bus driver to log into school and parent to login
* notification system for parents that let them know from the bus driver that they arrived at the childs address
* an easy to read list for bus driver of the kids that are on the bus
* once the bus driver selects a kid on the list, a map shows up so they can drop him/her off (with directions maybe?)
* (going off from the list of kids from 2 points ago) a checklist type of thing where the buss driver checks off which kid got dropped off
* an optimized route for all available kids on the bus for the bus driver to follow, and kids checked off from checklist and notifies parents.

My idea consist on an app dedicated to facilitate the creating of work schedule for a wide range of size of company. The app consist of a simple is a simple interface that shows important information such as budget for the month, allocated manhours and target / expectation.

The app can will provide the following services:

1. Easy to use interface.
2. User credential authentication.
3. Dragable interactivity.
4. Content exportation to a wide varierty of formats such as PDF, CSV or Excel.
5. Data storage in a cloud database.

#### Previous Work

##### SpotOn

A [GPS](https://github.com/CPSpotOn/SpotOn) app that allows you to travel with other together in a single instance of map. Track places where travel buddies have been to. It also allows for sharing spots in town that would have gone unnoticed by visitors otherwise.

## Project idea:

``What does the web application do?``
My idea is to build a web application that offers table tennis after-school programs to NYC schools. This web app is going to offer information about the program such as the benefits the students get from participating in the program.  A form where principals and teachers that are interested in having the program can fill out, to have an understanding what would be the best option for them. The website is going to showcase the different events that our students do such as tournaments, leagues and exhibitions. This web app is promoting physical and mental health through table tennis. 

``Why Table Tennis?``
I chose table tennis because it is a sport that brings so many benefits to our communities, especially to kids and teenagers that are still in school.  I choose this project because table tennis is not popular in NYC schools, and we want to make an impact. It is a sport that can be played all around the year, it is a safe sport that contributes to students' cognitive abilities and hand-eye coordination, and it does not require a big space to get started. 

``Which types of people would want to use this application?``
Spin and Learn is mainly used by school leaders and educators; a third user would be students' parents since they can also recommend the program to the schools.
